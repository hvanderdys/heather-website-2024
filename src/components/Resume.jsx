      <h3>ALWAYS CREATING AND SEAKING OUT CHALLENGES</h3>
      <p>
        After Graduating Magna Cum Laude with my BFA from the University of
        Texas at Arlington in 2011, I was privileged to feature in the roving
        art show around Dallas, Texas, and interned professionally under a local
        photographer. Then I served as a Creative and Communications Director
        for three years before becoming a freelance artist/designer and
        beginning a custom solution design and development agency.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        My main passion is to bring ideas to life. I love working with
        businesses, visionaries, and innovative individuals. For my personal
        work and touch, I am influenced by a love of logic, engineering, travel,
        and nature.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        My &ldquo;talent stack&rdquo; involves experience as a designer,
        tackling projects across the web and print, including UI/UX and Product
        Design. I have creates project as small as 1/4 in pins and as large as
        turck and stage wraps measuring 15+ feet. As a side hustle and hobby,
        you can see (mainly on my Instagram feed) a love for hands-on mediums
        involving mostly watercolor and large murals. After living over 6 years
        in Eastern Europe, my love of design has evolved to take cultures,
        colors, and simplicity into this season of my fine art and design
        principles.

        Also, while oversees I found a propensity for making relationships with
        small business owners. over the last decade I have succesfully helped
        launch a hotel, restraunt, gast station, floral shop, and more. I have
        rebranded companies, revamped and redesigned websites, and overseen SEO
        and SEM improvments. I have spent hours upon hours meeting small
        businiess owners and discussing and planning on managable strategies we
        can implement together to help the flow and reach of their beloved
        businesses.

      <h3>How This Crazy “Talent Stack” Found Me</h3>
      <p>
        When I say “Talent Stack,” I am quoting from others. It is simply how we
        “Combine a bunch of <strong>skills</strong> [and experiences] in a way
        that makes [all of us unique and] extraordinary.” I entered the
        professional arena armed with a distinctive amalgamation of skills and
        experiences—a talent stack that has evolved over the years. I came into
        the work world with{" "}
        <strong>
          art fundamentals, business strategy education, printing experience,
        </strong>{" "}
        and <strong>lighting knowledge.</strong> This was “stacked” on top of my
        driven <strong>work ethic, multi-tasking,</strong> and{" "}
        <strong>sales experience</strong> from working my way through college
        the previous 4.5-5 years. I also started with the skills or talents of{" "}
        <strong>organizing, 3D visualization,</strong> and{" "}
        <strong>quick learning/adaptation.</strong> I graduated high school and
        college with almost perfect grades, had remained 1st-2nd chair in the
        band throughout college, and had never applied for a job I didn’t
        receive. Needless to say, I was barely in my 20s, and as I learned
        lessons and came into the working world, I realized many things about
        the workspace and career/business development.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        My first job in my BFA field was as an apprentice/assistant under a
        small business owner, and maybe that is why, still to this day, I love{" "}
        <strong>working B2B</strong> (business to business.)
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <p>
        As I transitioned to my role as a Creative and Communication Director
        for a church, I honed my skills in{" "}
        <strong>
          digital engagement, branding consistency, efficient design, project
          management, timeline planning, team leading, business budgeting,
        </strong>{" "}
        and <strong>paid marketing</strong> (digital and print.)
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <p>
        Then, in 2016, my family gathered our love for{" "}
        <strong>
          music, art, children, small businesses, local community,
        </strong>{" "}
        and <strong>adventure.</strong> We moved to a remote village in Romania
        and started our own consulting company where we could have the
        flexibility to help run church camps, tutor children, and much more.
        Running this consulting firm through ups and downs taught me about{" "}
        <strong>
          client relations, product design, wireframing, UI/UX,
          consulting/contracting, brand management, brand guidelines, social
          media marketing, copywriting, app development, website management,
          content management, data illustration, packaging design, menu design,
          responsive design,
        </strong>{" "}
        and <strong>work-life balance.</strong> Also during these 6 years
        overseas, I learned basic <strong>front-end development</strong> from my
        spouse as we juggled multiple projects at the same time. Working with
        non-profits also added to my talent stack by{" "}
        <strong>
          planning events, marketing events, leading worship, photographing
          events, multilingual web management, filming content, editing and
          translating video,
        </strong>{" "}
        and <strong>translating content.</strong> The time traveling and the
        time in entrepreneurship also allowed me to teach, which is the best way
        to learn and reinforce knowledge. I taught intro classes to
        <strong>
          {" "}
          Excel, Microsoft, HTML, digital security, web design, branding,
          crafts, painting, watercolor,
        </strong>{" "}
        and <strong>budgeting.</strong>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        As we transitioned back to the United States (Still traveling back and
        forth as time allows) I helped co-found an <strong>LMS</strong> and{" "}
        <strong>employee engagement</strong> software company and started
        freelancing as a{" "}
        <strong>
          Digital Scribe (also known as a Digital Recorder or illustrative
          Notetaker).
        </strong>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I have since continued contracting and freelancing for multiple clients.
        I currently contract to design and develop{" "}
        <strong>user experiences, landing pages, SEO and SEM plans,</strong> and{" "}
        <strong>application designs.</strong>
